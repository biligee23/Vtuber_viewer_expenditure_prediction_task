# Data Science class Project

![Project Report](banner.png)

This project was created as a personal tool to help me sing Japanese songs by providing romanized lyrics. While it's relatively easy to find romanized lyrics manually, I wanted to combine APIs from **Spotify**, **Genius**, and **YouTube** to create an all-in-one application that:

1. Searches for songs using Spotify.
2. Fetches lyrics from Genius.
3. Romanizes Japanese lyrics using `pykakasi` and `jaconv`.
4. Embeds YouTube videos for song playback (since Spotify API does not allow full song playback within applications).

## Features

- **Search Songs**: Use Spotify's API to search for songs and retrieve metadata like song title, artist name, and album cover.
- **Fetch Lyrics**: Retrieve lyrics for the selected song from Genius API.
- **Romanize Lyrics**: Convert Japanese lyrics into Romanized form using `pykakasi` and `jaconv`.
- **YouTube Playback**: Embed a YouTube video of the song for playback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive UI built with Bootstrap.

  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)
  - LyricsGenius (Genius API wrapper)
  - Pykakasi and Jaconv (Japanese text romanization)
  - Requests (HTTP requests to YouTube API)

- **Frontend**:

  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Custom styles + Bootstrap)
  - JavaScript (Loader functionality)

- **APIs**:

  - Spotify API (Song search and metadata)
  - Genius API (Lyrics retrieval)
  - YouTube Data API (Video embedding)

- **Other Tools**:
  - Python-dotenv (Environment variable management)
  - Flask-Caching (Optional, for caching API responses)
